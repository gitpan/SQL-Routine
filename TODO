TODO

- Continue fleshing out the standard_routine enumerated type documentation.

- Add more deferred constraints to reduce erroneous models.

- Keep watch on the separately released "Rosetta" framework modules and ensure
we continue to meet their needs.

- Strive for complete code coverage in the tests.
