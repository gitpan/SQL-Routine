TODO

- Rewrite significant portions of the main documentation in Routine.pm and
Language.pod to better explain the current functional domain of SQL::Routine
and emphasize its routine-centric conceptualization of things, vs the more
generic tree conceptualization of the old SQL::SyntaxModel.

- Remove the distinct 'command' Nodes and merge related concepts into both
routines and standard procedures/functions.  After the change, one would define
a 'routine' to do DDL just as they are used for DML now.

- Make standard procedures/functions take named arguments rather than
positional ones, just as user-defined routines do.

- Miscellaneous cleanup.

- Add more deferred constraints to reduce erroneous models.

- Keep watch on the separately released "Rosetta" framework modules and ensure
we continue to meet their needs.
