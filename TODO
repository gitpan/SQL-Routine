TODO

- Implement the ROW, SC_ARY, RW_ARY container types for use as
routine variables, arguments, return values.  Update views to handle them. 
Possible generalization between those and the 'table' Node.  These are
necessary for many TRIGGER implementations.  Also useful for user-defined
routines that want to return all rows from a select or cursor as an array.

- Continue fleshing out the standard_routine enumerated type documentation.

- Add more deferred constraints to reduce erroneous models.

- Keep watch on the separately released "Rosetta" framework modules and ensure
we continue to meet their needs.

- Strive for complete code coverage in the tests.
