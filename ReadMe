PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "SQL::Routine"; see the files
lib/SQL/Routine.pm and lib/SQL/Routine/Language.pod for the roots of the main
documentation, which is in POD format.  The distribution also includes a
ChangeLog file to say what changes already happened, and a TODO file to say what
changes have yet to happen.  The file INSTALL should help with installation
issues.  Read below for how to get support or keep up to date, know this
distribution's dependencies, or read the credits or copyright and license.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

DEPENDENCIES

Perl Version: 5.008001

Core Modules:

	Scalar::Util 1.11 (for weak refs)
	Test::More 0.47 (but only for the test suite)

Non-Core Modules: 

	Locale::KeyedText 1.04 (for error messages)

This module doesn't require anything else.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

=head1 CREDITS

Besides myself as the creator ...

* 2004.05.20 - Thanks to Jarrell Dunson (jarrell_dunson@asburyseminary.edu) for
inspiring me to add some concrete SYNOPSIS documentation examples to this
module, which demonstrate actual SQL statements that can be generated from parts
of a model, when he wrote me asking for examples of how to use this module.

* 2005.03.21 - Thanks to Stevan Little (stevan@iinteractive.com) for feedback
towards improving this module's documentation, particularly towards using a much
shorter SYNOPSIS, so that it is easier for newcomers to understand the module at
a glance, and not be intimidated by large amounts of detailed information.  Also
thanks to Stevan for introducing me to Scalar::Util::weaken(); by using it,
SQL::Routine objects can be garbage collected normally despite containing
circular references, and users no longer need to invoke destructor methods.

Linking SQL::Routine statically or dynamically with other modules is making a

cover the whole combination.  As a special exception, the copyright holders of
SQL::Routine give you permission to link SQL::Routine with independent modules,
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and

that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of the
source code of SQL::Routine (the version of SQL::Routine used to produce the
combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GPL plus this
exception.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on SQL::Routine, and which is fully useable when not linked to
SQL::Routine in any form.

Any versions of SQL::Routine that you modify and distribute must carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
changes, in addition to preserving this original copyright notice and other

While it is by no means required, the copyright holders of SQL::Routine would
appreciate being informed any time you create a modified version of
SQL::Routine that you are willing to distribute, because that is a practical
way of suggesting improvements to the standard version.
