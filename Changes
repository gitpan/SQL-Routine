	* SQL-Routine Release 0.59.

	* New code file versions are: Routine.pm v0.59 and en.pm v0.28.

	* Added new external dependency on Scalar::Util v1.11 (bundled with Perl
	5.8.x); SQL::Routine now uses its 'weak refs' feature internally at
	strategic places so that you no longer need to explicitly destroy Containers
	when you are done with them.  The circular references between SRT Nodes and
	their Container no longer prevent Perl's standard garbage collection from
	working when expected, which is when all external references to a Container
	go away.  This change makes SQL::Routine much more DWIM and easier to use.

	* Updated Routine.pm and Details.pod:  Removed the Container.destroy()
	method.  Removed the CAVEATS documentation concerning it.  Updated
	SQL_Routine.t to remove all destroy() invocations, which also reduced the
	test count by 6 to 35.  Removed the corresponding TODO file item.

	* Updated Routine.pm:  Updated the definitions of 3 Node properties to
	indicate that they now store weak Perl refs rather than strong ones:
	'pp_nref', 'at_nrefs', 'container'.  Those 3 properties are all 'upwards' or
	'parent pointing' references; each has one or more corresponding 'child
	pointing' properties which remain strong refs.  As such, every conceptual
	circular reference now has one strong and one weak member.  A total of 5
	Scalar::Util::weaken() invocations are now used (up from zero): 1 is in
	Node._set_primary_parent_attribute(); 1 is in Node._set_literal_attribute();
	3 are in Node.put_in_container(), one per property.

	* Updated Routine.pm and Details.pod and en.pm:  Removed the
	Node.delete_node() method, which was a no-op routine and never invoked; a
	SRT Node has always been garbage collected by Perl as is normal.  This
	method had existed as a place-holder for an eventual C implementation that
	actually did something, but since a C version is very far away, if it ever
	comes, this has been removed meanwhile.  Also removed the corresponding
	en.pm user text message 'SRT_N_DEL_NODE_IN_CONT'.

	* Updated both CREDITS copies regarding Stevan Little's contribution, to add 
	that he introduced me to Scalar::Util::weaken() last month.

	* Added new CAVEATS item and TODO file item concerning external refs to
	Nodes whose host Container was garbage collected.

	* Renamed this file to 'Changes' from 'ChangeLog'; the new name is more
	descriptive to its free-form structure, and more consistent with CPAN (which
	uses both names but 'Changes' seems to be more common these days).  Also
	truncated this Changes file to remove all detail entries for releases v0.28
	thru v0.58; in their place was added a change summary for releases v0.01
	thru v0.58 that mainly just said what the names and versions of all the
	predecessor distributions and modules are.

	was in the form of executable code, and not just design documentation.

2003-02-10   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta Release 0.04 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release of
	any distribution for which all of the existing work that became the
	SQL-Routine distribution was purely in the form of design documentation,
	without executable code of any kind.

2003-01-27   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta Release 0.02 was released on CPAN; this is the first release of

2003-01-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* DBIx-Portable Release 0.01 was released on CPAN; this is the only release
	of the DBIx-Portable distribution.  This is the first release of any
	distribution to contain design documentation that became the SQL-Routine
	distribution.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the modules which became the SQL-Routine
	distribution as their own entity that is separate from my application, for
	open-source distribution on CPAN.  The modules were to comprise an
	RDBMS-generic DB framework for any application to use.

	* Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

	* Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which added
	an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for each page
	request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl code.

2002-06-07

	* Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
	self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema, user
	interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost completely
	rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules for database
	communication and the web interface logic, with MySQL-specific code and
	database generic or data dictionary code in separate files, and separate
	files for parts of the web interface.  The program used the same generic
	CPAN modules as in the first prototype, DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

2001-11-24

	* Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

	* Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
	self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross between
	a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical or
	genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes of code
	that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's code, for
	database communication and web interface logic, was situated in a single
	module, with the rest of the program being more generic CPAN modules like
	DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

	* Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have something to
	start developing, testing and deploying database driven applications on.
