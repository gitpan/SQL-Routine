                             SQL-Routine
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2005-09-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine Release 0.70.1 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: Routine.pm 0.70.1 and en.pm 0.38.1.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    0.59 thru 0.70.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

    Rosetta/SQL-Routine developer release #3.

    * Rosetta Release 0.05, containing Rosetta::Schema::DataType 0.01, was
    released on CPAN.  This is the first release of any distribution to
    contain Rosetta::Schema::DataType.  This is the first release of any
    distribution for which some of the existing work that became the
    SQL-Routine distribution was in the form of executable code, and not
    just design documentation.

2003-02-10   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.04 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release
    of any distribution for which all of the existing work that became the
    SQL-Routine distribution was purely in the form of design
    documentation, without executable code of any kind.

2003-01-27   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.02 was released on CPAN; this is the first release
    of the Rosetta distribution.  Early versions of the design
    documentation that became the SQL-Routine distribution were included.

2003-01-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * DBIx-Portable Release 0.01 was released on CPAN; this is the only
    release of the DBIx-Portable distribution.  This is the first release
    of any distribution to contain design documentation that became the
    SQL-Routine distribution.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Began development on the modules which became the SQL-Routine
    distribution as their own entity that is separate from my application,
    for open-source distribution on CPAN.  The modules were to comprise an
    RDBMS-generic DB framework for any application to use.

    * Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

    * Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which
    added an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for
    each page request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl
    code.

2002-06-07

    * Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
    self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema,
    user interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost
    completely rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules
    for database communication and the web interface logic, with
    MySQL-specific code and database generic or data dictionary code in
    separate files, and separate files for parts of the web interface.  The
    program used the same generic CPAN modules as in the first prototype,
    DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

    * This is when I started writing self-contained code components that
    were explicitly designed to enable external code that used them to work
    seamlessly on multiple database products, and hence 2002 is the start
    of my declared copyright date range for SQL::Routine.

2001-11-24

    * Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

    * Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
    self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross
    between a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical
    or genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes
    of code that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's
    code, for database communication and web interface logic, was situated
    in a single module, with the rest of the program being more generic
    CPAN modules like DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

    * Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have
    something to start developing, testing and deploying database driven
    applications on.
