	* Release 0.43.

	* This is the first version of the SQL-Routine distribution under that
	name, which follows the official registration of SQL::Routine with the Perl
	5 Module List.  The core module has been renamed to SQL::Routine from
	SQL::SyntaxModel, its previous name; all similarly named modules and files
	were correspondingly renamed.  All name-related strings, both in code and
	documentation, were updated as follows: "SyntaxModel" -> "Routine", "SSM"
	-> "SRT", "SQLSM" -> "SQLRT", "sqlsm" -> "sqlrt".

	* New code file versions are: Routine.pm v0.43 and en.pm v0.15.

	* Updated external dependencies on Locale::KeyedText to v1.00.

	* Changed the NAME of Routine.pm to "Specify all database tasks with SQL
	routines" from "An abstract syntax tree for all types of SQL".

	* Aside from the name references, version numbers, and dependencies, no
	changes were made to any code or documentation between SQL-SyntaxModel-0.42
	and SQL-Routine-0.43.  A significant update to the main documentation is 
	planned for v0.44 which reflects the module's current functional domain.

	* For historical posterity, here is this distribution's file manifest:

	* Rewrote the TODO file so it actually lists some near-future plans.

	The next version of the Module List will list the following module:

	  modid:       SQL::Routine
	  DSLIP:       cdpOg
	  description: Specify all database tasks with SQL routines
	  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)

	  enteredby:   BDFOY (brian d foy)
	  enteredon:   Mon Oct  4 20:04:46 2004 GMT

	The resulting entry will be:

	SQL::

	* SQL-SyntaxModel-0.42, the last version of the distribution having that
	name which contained the modules that became the SQL-Routine distribution,
	was released on CPAN.

2004-03-22   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* SQL-SyntaxModel-0.28, the first version of a distribution having that
	name, was released on CPAN.  Early versions of the modules that became the
	SQL-Routine distribution were included.

	* Rosetta-0.27, the last version of the distribution having that name which
	contained the modules that became the SQL-Routine distribution, was
	released on CPAN.

2003-01-27   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta-0.02, the first version of a distribution having that name, was
	released on CPAN.  Early versions of the modules that became the
	SQL-Routine distribution were included.

2003-01-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* DBIx-Portable-0.01, the only version of a distribution having that name,
	was released on CPAN.  Early versions of the modules that became the
	SQL-Routine distribution were included.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the modules which became the SQL-Routine
	distribution as their own entity that is separate from my application, for
	open-source distribution on CPAN.  The modules were to comprise an
	RDBMS-generic DB framework for any application to use.

	* Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

	* Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which added
	an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for each page
	request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl code.

2002-06-07

	* Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
	self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema, user
	interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost completely
	rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules for database
	communication and the web interface logic, with MySQL-specific code and
	database generic or data dictionary code in separate files, and separate
	files for parts of the web interface.  The program used the same generic
	CPAN modules as in the first prototype, DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

2001-11-24

	* Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

	* Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
	self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross between
	a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical or
	genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes of code
	that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's code, for
	database communication and web interface logic, was situated in a single
	module, with the rest of the program being more generic CPAN modules like
	DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

	* Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have something to
	start developing, testing and deploying database driven applications on.
